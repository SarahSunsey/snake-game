# Snake Game in Java

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Java.

## Description

The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food pellets to grow larger. The game continues until the snake either collides with the screen's boundaries or with itself.

## Features

- **Snake Movement**: The snake can be controlled using arrow keys to move up, down, left, or right.
- **Food Pellets**: Randomly generated food pellets appear on the screen for the snake to eat.
- **Scoring**: Each time the snake eats a food pellet, the score increases.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the snake collides with the screen's boundaries or with itself.
- **Restart Option**: After the game ends, the player has the option to restart the game.
